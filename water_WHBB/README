Potential energy surface (and dipole moment surface) for water [WHBB]

I. INSTALLATION

1) Uncompress and extract the tar file:

        $ tar xzvf water_WHBB.tgz

   This will create a target directory 'water_WHBB' inlcudes all library and
   data files, source code, test program and some geometries.


II. TEST
   Source codes for test program are provided in the 'water_WHBB/src'.

1) Edit the file 'Makefile' in 'water_WHBB/src' directory

        $ cd water_WHBB/src
        $ vi Makefile

   You might want to modify some of the following variables in the Makefile
        a. $FC     --- PATH to the Intel Fortran Compiler
        b. $LIBDIR --- Location of the library files
        c. $MODDIR --- Location of the module files

3) Compile the source codes 

	$ make 

   This will generate an executable called 'getpot'. 

4) Calculate the potential, gradient and the dipole moment at a given structure

        >./getpot xyz/trimer.xyz 
  
   The code first reads the coordinates from the file given in the argument
   and calculates the potential energy and gradient using the water potential,
   WHBB/3b5, and then calls dipole moment routine to compute DMS(1,2).

   * Please refer to References for detail about WHBB/3b5 and DMS(1,2).


III Miscellaneoius
 
1) Data files in the 'water_WHBB/data' directory

   data/WHBB_MP2_3b5                 --- coefs of 5th-order 3-body fit
   data/WHBB_MP2_3b6                 --- coefs of 6th-order 3-body fit
   data/fit0000.out.pes4X1-T1.090915 --- coefs of 2-body potential fit
   data/h4o2.dms4.coeff.dat          --- coefs of 1,2-body dipole moment fit

   * WHBB/3b5 PES is used by default. One can change between 5th-order fit and
   6th-order fit, or change the location of data file by modifying 'pes_init'
   subroutine in 'src/pes_shell.f90'.

2) Format of the input geometry
   
   By default, the unit of the Cartesian coordinates is assumed to be
   Angstrom.  Atoms need to be in the order of ascending mass, so "H" always
   goes before "O". All "H" atoms and "O" atoms should be listed in the same
   monomer order.  For example, a water dimer should look like, "H1 H2 H3 H4
   O5 O6", where H1-O5-H2 is one monomer and H3-O6-H4 is the second monomer.

3) Numerical gradient and hessian
   
   According to the definition our water potential, numerical gradient and
   hessian can be calculated highly efficiently. Thus, we provide in this
   package optimized routines to calculate numerical gradient. Similar
   routines for hessian would be available upon request.

4) Both serial and parallel versions of library and module files compiled
   using Intel Fortran Compiler (64 bit V.10.1) are provided. Parallel version
   is clearly labelled with 'omp' suffix.

5) The original F77 code of water monomer potential due to H. Partridge and
   D. W. Schwenke (J. Chem. Phys. 106, 4618 (2007)) has been restructured in
   the current release of our water potential (cf 'pot_monomer.f90' and
   'pot_monomer_mod.f90').

6) Also the latest extension of the flexible, polarizable, Thole-type model
   potential (TTM3-F, v. 3.0) due to G. S. Fanourgakis and S. S. Xantheas
   (J. Chem. Phys. 128, 074506 (2008), http://www.pnl.gov/science/ttm3f.asp)
   are included in the current release with minor modifications on data
   structure.
